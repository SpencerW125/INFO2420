    <h2>Questions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>  
        <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
        on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
        <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
        <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
        it? Why?</li>
        <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
        reasonable?</li>
        <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
        image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
        <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
        navigation well done?</li>
        <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
        the pages?</li>
        <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
        <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Website 1 Critique - Trader Joe's</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>My first impression of this website was that it was rather plain, it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the majority of the site is plain white so it doesn't look very advanced.</li>
        <li>The site has a bar with options to see products, recipes, and other things at the left of the screen that follows you down as you scroll through the site. Other than that the home page seems to have various different bits of content put out by TJ.</li>
        <li>I like the bar on the left of the screen and how its always visible on the page. Other than that I dont really like the homepage since a lot of the information on the home page seems random and unhelpful outside of niche circumstances.</li>
        <li>The few images they have on the site do help it look better and add some much needed color.</li>
        <li>The home page loads almost instantly.</li>
        <li>Most of the text is black and easy to read.</li>
        <li>The navigation bar can be accessed on the panel that stays on the left side of the screen. Since it is easy to see and accessible, I would say its well done.</li>
        <li>The site consistently just has a white background, all the pages feel similar to each other.</li>
        <li>The website is responsive and adapts to window size.</li>
        <li>Overall the site seems fairly basic. Something unique is that it has links to so many random resources like tons of recipes and bits of news about food.</li>

    <h2>Website 2 Critique - jamilin</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>My first impression of this site was being startled by how many times the same face is staring at me with the same look and smile, also some of the biggest images looks blurry and low quality. </li>
        <li>The home page has many different links that are small and might be overlooked if you dont pay attention.</li>
        <li>I guess it makes sense in that it has a homepage with links that lead to all the dirrent sections of the site.</li>
        <li>Yes the multimedia detracts from it. Essentially every picture is of the exact same lady, same smile, same everything. 6 times in the same screen. Greatly detracts from the quality.</li>
        <li>it loads within a second, so at least its fine in that aspect.</li>
        <li>Besides the white links over colors like yellow, everything else is fairly easy to read.</li>
        <li>There is no search bar, only the small links on the colored boxes.</li>
        <li>No, the style differs across the different pages and is inconsistent.</li>
        <li>The site does seem somewhat responsive.</li>
        <li>It offers a popup box that calls you a dearest galactic spirit. I have never seen that before.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Website 3 Critique - Sabletine</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>The most bland site I have critiqued so far, the whole thing is 95% white.</li>
        <li>There are some small words that I later found out where links to different parts of the site, easy to miss.</li>
        <li>Once you find the small bar of link it makes sense, but it should be more obvious.</li>
        <li>The graphic giving a general idea of where the location could be found on a map is somewhat helpful. The bright pink boxes that are apparently links stand out, but are not obviously links.</li>
        <li>It loads instantly.</li>
        <li>The text color and size against the white background makes it easy to read.</li>
        <li>No the navigation is not well done, it is small and easy to miss.</li>
        <li>The theme remains consistent across the pages.</li>
        <li>The site is not responsive at all so far as I can tell.</li>
        <li>There is essentially nothing unique or very well done.</li>
    </ol>
